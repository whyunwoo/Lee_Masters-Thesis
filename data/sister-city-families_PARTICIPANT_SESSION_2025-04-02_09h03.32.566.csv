        <p>
            In this study, we are interested in how people think about different Google Street View images. Google Street View takes pictures of streets used for Google Earth and Google Maps. You’ll see Google Street View images of different places and answer some questions about each one.

            <br><br>
            <hr>
            Are only <b>a few parts</b> of the scene <b>invisible or obscured</b>, or are <b>many parts invisible or obscured</b>?

            <hr>
            <p>
            There are no right or wrong answers: we are interested in <b>your</b> impression. Note that some images might have individual buildings or faces blurred for privacy. Please ignore these when making your judgments.
